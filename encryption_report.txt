============================================================
        AI-DRIVEN ENCRYPTION SECURITY REPORT
============================================================

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
This report provides an AI-driven analysis of the encryption implementation.
The overall security rating is Strong.

KEY STRENGTH ANALYSIS
------------------------------
Key Length: 256 bits (Excellent - Suitable for top-secret data)
Entropy: 7.92/8.00 (99.0%) (Excellent entropy)

ENCRYPTION ALGORITHM ANALYSIS
------------------------------
AES-256: Very Strong | Fast | Recommended for sensitive data encryption
RSA-2048: Strong | Slow | Use for small data encryption or signatures

DATA INTEGRITY CHECK
------------------------------
Hash Verification: Passed (SHA-256 hash matches original)
AI Tampering Detection: No tampering detected (AI model confidence: 98.5%)

RECOMMENDATIONS
------------------------------
1. Use Authenticated Encryption (AES-GCM or ChaCha20-Poly1305)
2. Implement Secure Key Management
3. Regular Key Rotation
